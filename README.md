# Edubadges Server (Backend)

*Digital badge management for issuers, earners, and consumers*

EduBadges server is the Python/Django API backend for issuing [Open Badges](http://openbadges.org). In addition to a powerful Issuer API and browser-based user interface for issuing, edubadges offers integrated badge management and sharing for badge earners. 

See also [edubadges-ui](https://github.com/edubadges/badgr-ui), the Angular front end that serves as users' interface for this project.

This software is based on the Badgr software from [Concentric Sky](https://github.com/concentricsky/).

## Edubadges and microcredentialing
Institutions are looking into the possibilities of using digital certification for (partial) results obtained by their students. In 2019, SURF will work with various institutions to continue to build a digital infrastructure with the purpose to be able to issue such digital certificates, or 'edubadges'.

## Edubadges: tool for flexible education
An increasing number of students have âˆ’ whether previously or elsewhere âˆ’ acquired skills and knowledge relevant to their study, and they wish to receive recognition or exemption for this in their study programme. A number of institutions are looking into the possibility of providing courses in accredited units that are smaller than a diploma (micro-credentials). Digital badges are the tools to achieve this. As these badges are issued in an educational context, they are called 'edubadges'.

### About the Badgr Project
Badgr was developed by [Concentric Sky](https://concentricsky.com), starting in 2015 to serve as an open source reference implementation of the Open Badges Specification. It provides functionality to issue portable, verifiable Open Badges as well as to allow users to manage badges they have been awarded by any issuer that uses this open data standard. Since 2015, Badgr has grown to be used by hundreds of educational institutions and other people and organizations worldwide. See [Project Homepage](https://badgr.org) for more details about contributing to and integrating with Badgr.

# Edubadges Install Instructions (Backend Docker and Database containers on CentOS 7)
These sample instructions will build 2 Docker images: 
* the edubadges backend django web container

### Create project directory and environment

* `mkdir badgr && cd badgr`
* `virtualenv env`
* `source env/bin/activate` *Activate the environment (each time you start a session working with the code)*

*Obtain source code and clone into code directory*

* `git clone https://github.com/concentricsky/badgr-server.git code`
* `cd code`

*Your Directory structure will look like this with default logs and mediafiles locations:*
```
badgr
â”œâ”€â”€ code
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ apps
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ docs
â”œâ”€â”€ env
```

### Install requirements
*from within code directory*

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Customize local settings to your environment
* `cp apps/mainsite/settings_local.py.example apps/mainsite/settings_local.py`
* Edit the settings_local.py file and insert local credentials for DATABASES and email, then run the following from within the `code` directory:

### Migrate databases, build front-end components
* `./manage.py migrate` - set up database tables
* `./manage.py dist` - generate docs swagger file(s)
* `./manage.py createsuperuser` - follow prompts to create your first admin user account


### Prvovision database
* Login the admin interface of the server and: 
1) Add a badgeuser_termsversion
2) Add a socialaccount_socialapp for edu_id and surf_conext (with these names)
- Make sure the SITE_ID defined in your settings file (SITE_ID = 1) matches yours in the database

### Install and run Badgr UI {#badgr-ui}
Start in your `badgr` directory and clone badgr-ui source code: `git clone https://github.com/edubadges/badgr-ui.git badgr-ui`

* Change to the `badgr-ui` directory and install dependencies. We recommend using a recent version of node and npm to run `npm install`.
* To run the Angular badgr-ui local server run `npm run start`

For more details view the Readme for [Badgr UI](https://github.com/edubadges/badgr-ui.git).

### Run a server locally for development
* `./manage.py runserver`
* Navigate to http://localhost:8000/staff
* Sign in as your superuser you created above

API documentation is viewable at `/docs`

#### Badgr App Configuration
* Sign in to http://localhost:8000/staff
* View the "Badgr app" records and use the staff admin forms to create a BadgrApp. BadgrApp(s) describe the configuration that badgr-server needs to know about an associated installation of badgr-ui.

If your badgr-ui is running on http://localhost:4000, use the following values:
* CORS: ensure this setting matches the domain on which you are running badgr-ui, including the port if other than the standard HTTP or HTTPS ports. `localhost:4000`
* Signup redirect: `http://localhost:4000/signup/`
* Email confirmation redirect: `http://localhost:4000/auth/login/`
* Forgot password redirect: `http://localhost:4000/change-password/`
* UI login redirect: `http://localhost:4000/auth/login/`
* UI signup success redirect: `http://localhost:4000/signup/success/`
* UI connect success redirect: `http://localhost:4000/profile/`
* Public pages redirect: `http://localhost:4000/public/`

#### Additional Configuration

**Sign-In Configuration**

* [Create an oAuth2 Provider Application](http://localhost:8000/staff/oauth2_provider/application/add/) with
    * Client id: `public`
    * Client type: Public
    * allowed scopes: `rw:profile rw:issuer rw:backpack`
    * Authorization grant type: Resource owner password-based
    * Name: `localdev`
    * Redirect uris: `http://localhost:4000`

**User Configuration**

* [Edit your super user](http://localhost:8000/staff/badgeuser/badgeuser/1/change/)
    * Add an email address, check "verified" and "primary"

* [Create an oAuth2 Provider Application](http://localhost:8000/staff/oauth2_provider/application/add/) with
    * Client id: `public`
    * Client type: Public
    * allowed scopes: `rw:profile rw:issuer rw:backpack`
    * Authorization grant type: Resource owner password-based
    * Name: `localdev`
    * Redirect uris: `http://localhost:4000`

### Additional configuration options
Set these values in your settings_local.py file to configure the application to your specific needs. Required options are listed in bold.
* *HELP_EMAIL* (Required)
  - An email address for your support staff.
* BADGR_APPROVED_ISSUERS_ONLY:
  - If you choose to use the BADGR_APPROVED_ISSUERS_ONLY flag, this means new user accounts will not be able to define new issuers (though they can be added as staff on issuers defined by others) unless they have the Django user permission 'issuer.add_issuer'. The recommended way to grant users this privilege is to create a group that grants it in the `/staff` admin area and addthe appropriate users to that group.
* GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID:
  - Google Analytics code will be inserted into your pages if this is set to your account tracking code, e.g. 'UA-3929083373-2'. See https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080
* PINGDOM_MONITORING_ID:
  - If you use Pingdom to monitor site performance, including this setting will embed Pingdom tracking script into the header.
* CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER = True
  - Celery is an asynchronous task runner built into Django and Badgr. Advanced deployments may separate celery workers from web nodes for improved performance. For development environments where Celery tasks should run synchronously, set this flag to true. Very few tasks are part of this repository, and eager is a safe setting for most production deploys.
* OPEN_FOR_SIGNUP = True
  - This defaults to True, but allows you to turn off signup if you would like to use Badgr for only single-account use or to manually create all users in `/staff`.
* PAGINATION_SECRET_KEY:
  - Key used for symmetrical encryption of pagination cursors.  If not defined, encryption is disabled.  Must be 32 byte, base64-encoded random string.  For example: python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key())"
